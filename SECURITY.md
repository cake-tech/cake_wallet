## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you need to report a vulnerability, please either:

* Open a security advisory: https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/security/advisories/new
* Send an email to `dev@cakewallet.com` with details on the vulnerability

## Supported Versions

As we don't maintain previous versions of the app, only the latest release for each platform is supported and any updates will bump the version number.
