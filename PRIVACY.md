Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It
------------------------------------------------------

	We collect several types of information from and about users of our App, including information:
		- By which you may be personally identified, such as name, e-mail address, or and a/any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline ("personal information" or "Personal Data”), ONLY when you provide it to us;
		- Device IP address, the block height to which your wallet is synchronized, and any transactions which you use our Node to submit to the Monero or Bitcoin or Litecoin networks.
	We collect this information:
		- Directly from you when you provide it to us.
		- Automatically as you use the App, if you use one of the Cake Wallet Nodes. Information collected automatically may include IP address and block height.

	Usage Data (including the date and time at which you use an application, the duration of using it, and other ‘metadata’) is NOT collected by Cake Technologies through the usage of the App. Cake Technologies has no reason to care about any aspect of your continued usage of our App. We believe that this data is your own property and that we have no right to collect it.

	Personal information is received by Cake Technologies ONLY in the event that you choose to provide it to us. This is provided either by synchronizing your wallet using the Nodes maintained by Cake Technologies, or by voluntarily contacting Cake Technologies regarding support, questions or suggestions. You also have the right to choose not to provide data to Cake Technologies, by choosing a different Node. The option to do so is provided by default with a list of Nodes, but Cake Wallet also provides the ability to add another Node not listed, or use your own Node.

	Data relating to your funds, and their security and privacy, remains on your device at ALL times. Your private keys, seeds, backup files, and wallet passcode are your own responsibility. This data is not received, collected, or stored by Cake Technologies at any time, for any reason.

	Personal Data collected through the Cake Wallet Nodes is limited to your device's IP address, the block height to which your wallet is synchronized, and any transactions which you use our Node to submit to the Monero or Bitcoin or Litecoin networks. Personal Data received by Cake Technologies in this manner is not stored for any length of time, and thus Cake Technologies is both unwilling to and incapable of sharing this data, or using it for any purpose beyond ensuring your appropriate connection to our Nodes.

	If you decide to use a Node offered by any third party, some of which we offer by default in the Cake Wallet Application, said third party will receive this Personal Data instead of Cake Technologies. We take no responsibility for the actions of any third-party Node offered within the Application. If you decide to synchronize your Wallet using your own Node, neither Cake Technologies nor any third party will have access to this Personal Data.

	In any of these situations, Cake Technologies takes no responsibility for interception of this data by any outside individual, group, corporation, or institution. You should understand this and take any and all appropriate actions to secure your own data.

How We Use Your Information
---------------------------

	We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:
		- To present our App and its contents to you.
		- To allow you to sync using the closest geographical Node: In the event that you choose to synchronize your wallet using the Node maintained by Cake Technologies, we determine your location using your IP address to redirect your Wallet to the fastest possible Node.
		- To contact you: In the event that you contact Cake Technologies first, we will use the Personal Data with which you provide us, to contact you by email, Telegram, Reddit, or any other means.
		- To manage your requests: To attend and manage your requests to us. 
		- For any other purpose with your consent.

Transfer of Your Personal Data
------------------------------

	Personal Data received by the Cake Wallet Nodes, or voluntarily submitted to Cake Technologies through e-mail, Telegram, Reddit, or any other method, may be transferred to computers located outside of your governmental jurisdiction, where the data protection laws may differ from yours. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, and your submission of such information, represents your agreement to this transfer.

	Cake Technologies will take all necessary steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country, unless there are adequate controls in place to protect the security of your data.

Disclosure of Your Information
------------------------------

	We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. For example, we may, from time to time, disclose the number of users who have downloaded our Application.
	
	We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:
		- To our subsidiaries and affiliates.
		- To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
		- To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Cake Technology's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Cake Technology about our App users is among the assets transferred. However, we will provide notice before this Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
		- To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. 
		- For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
		- With your consent.

	We may also disclose your personal information:
		- To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
		- To enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
		- If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cake Technologies, our customers, or others.

	Cake Technologies is incapable of providing any authority or government agency with data received by the Cake Wallet Nodes, because we do not store this data.

	Under certain circumstances, Cake Technologies may be required by authorities to disclose Personal Data which you voluntarily provide us, including your e-mail address, Telegram username, or Reddit username. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT TRANSMIT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO US VIA THESE OR ANY OTHER METHODS.

Data Security
-------------

	You are responsible for your personal data, including all data related to the safety of your funds. You should take all appropriate action to protect this data. Cake Technologies cannot recover any data related to your funds in the event that you lose or give away this data. Cake Technologies strongly recommends that you take action to secure your funds, by writing down your seeds or keys, storing encrypted backups, and never sharing this information.

	Cake Technologies undertakes any and all reasonable steps possible to secure any data that you voluntarily transmit to us. However, we cannot guarantee that any outside system used to transmit this data is entirely secure and, as such, we recommend that you exercise caution when voluntarily transmitting data to us.

Links to Other Websites
-----------------------

	The App may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

	It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you through a notice on the App. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of this document. You are responsible for periodically visiting our App and this privacy policy to check for any changes to our Privacy Policy.
