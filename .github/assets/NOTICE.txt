This is the Linux-penguin again...

Originally drewn by Larry Ewing (http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/)
(with the GIMP) the Linux Logo has been vectorized by me (Simon Budig,
http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/).

This happened quite some time ago with Corel Draw 4. But luckily 
meanwhile there are tools available to handle vector graphics with
Linux. Bernhard Herzog (bernhard@users.sourceforge.net) deserves kudos
for creating Sketch (http://sketch.sourceforge.net), a powerful free
tool for creating vector graphics. He converted the Corel Draw file to
the Sketch native format. Since I am unable to maintain the Corel Draw
file any longer, the Sketch version now is the "official" one.

Anja Gerwinski (anja@gerwinski.de) has created an alternate version of
the penguin (penguin-variant.sk) with a thinner mouth line and slightly
altered gradients. It also features a nifty drop shadow.

The third bird (penguin-flat.sk) is a version reduced to three colors
(black/white/yellow) for e.g. silk screen printing. I made this version
for a mug, available at the friendly folks at
http://www.kernelconcepts.de/ - they do good stuff, mail Petra
(pinguin@kernelconcepts.de) if you need something special or don't
understand the german  :-)

These drawings are copyrighted by Larry Ewing and Simon Budig
(penguin-variant.sk also by Anja Gerwinski), redistribution is free but
has to include this README/Copyright notice.

The use of these drawings is free. However I am happy about a sample of
your mug/t-shirt/whatever with this penguin on it...

Have fun 
    Simon Budig
