# Refund Policy

This Refund Policy covers returns, refunds, and cancellations for your purchases from Cake Technologies, LLC (“Company,” “we,” or “us”).

### Returns

We do not accept returns of cryptocurrencies. Once cryptocurrencies are delivered to the provided wallet address, we cannot accept a return. If we allow you to sell cryptocurrencies to us, you may optionally engage in another trade to convert the cryptocurrency to another asset at the price at that point in time.

### Refunds

We do not issue refunds except in the case of an error resulting in a non-delivery of cryptocurrencies. In this case, we will decide whether to complete the trade or refund the account. We endeavor to complete an investigation to determine whether an error occurred and to make this decision within ten (10) days of receipt of your error report, and we will do so in any case within ninety (90) days. We reserve the right to issue a refund for the equivalent amount in another asset at the exchange rate then offered by us should we determine an error occurred.

### Cancellations

Once you make a payment to us, trades cannot be cancelled. In nearly all cases, we deliver cryptocurrency to your address in a matter of seconds or minutes. If you have not received your purchased cryptocurrency within six (6) hours of completing payment and have confirmed that your wallet is connected to a reliable node and fully synchronized with the network, please contact us.

### Network Fees

We may charge a network fee for the delivery of cryptocurrencies. This will be clearly shown in the checkout page. If we issue a refund, we may choose to deduct any network fees from the refund, including any network fees incurred in processing the refund.

### Fraud

If you believe a cryptocurrency purchase was conducted fraudulently, please alert your bank or card issuer, as applicable, and follow their instructions. Please be aware that fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of your money with no recourse.
