    "question" : "What’s the difference between Available Balance and Full Balance?",
    "answer" : "After you make a transaction or receive some Monero, the transaction still needs to be confirmed. In about 20 minutes your available balance should update!\nSometimes, when you send Monero, your available balance will decrease by more than the amount you’ve sent. This is normal, and it’s necessary in order to protect your privacy. Your full balance should be back to normal in 20 minutes.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "How do I send Monero to an exchange that requires a Payment ID?",
    "answer" : "Tap the send button on the Wallet screen. Next, copy the exchange deposit address and paste it into the address box. Then, copy the Payment ID provided by the exchange and paste it into the Payment ID box. Finally, enter the amount you’d like to send, and you’re good to go!\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What do I do if I forgot to enter the Payment ID when sending Monero to an exchange?",
    "answer" : "While our support can’t directly help you with this issue, it’s a very common problem that most exchanges are used to dealing with. Just contact the exchange support, explain that you forgot to include your Payment ID, and then send them your Transaction ID as proof. You can find the Transaction ID by tapping on the transaction in your Wallet screen.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What do \"seed\" and \"keys\" mean?",
    "answer" : "Your keys encode the private information in your wallet, and are what allow you to spend coins and see incoming transactions.\nYour seed is just a version of your private key written in a way that’s easier for you to write down. Your seed and keys are actually the same thing, just in different forms!\nDO NOT ever give your seed or keys to anyone. Your funds will be stolen if you give out your seed or keys. Please write down your seed, however, and store it in a safe place (this will allow you to restore your wallet if you lose your phone.)\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "How many wallets can I create?",
    "answer" : "There is no limit! You can create as many wallets as you want.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "How can I restore my wallet?",
    "answer" : "Tap the ••• menu, select Wallets, and then choose Restore Wallet. Then enter your seed (or your keys), and optionally enter a date before the first transaction in your wallet (this will speed up the syncing process.) You may need to keep the app open for 15-30 minutes in order to completely restore your wallet.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What can I do if I lose my seed?",
    "answer" : "If you forgot your seed, you likely wrote it down somewhere. Please check your  notes and look around on your computer. If you can’t find it anywhere, you may have backed up Cake Wallet (in which case you would be able to restore from that backup.) If none of these work, there is unfortunately nothing that we can do.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "Do you collect any information about my wallet?",
    "answer" : "Cake Wallet DOES NOT collect or record any information about your wallet. We care about your privacy.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "Is it possible to reverse a transaction?",
    "answer" : "Unfortunately, as soon as a transaction has been submitted to the blockchain, there is no way to undo it. You can always cancel the transaction before it’s sent though, so always double-check the address before you send a transaction.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What are subaddresses, and how do I use them?",
    "answer" : "A subaddress is basically a unique address that you can generate at any time. Coins sent to it will still arrive in your main wallet, but the person sending the coins can’t tell what your main address is. Subaddresses always start with 8.\nYou can make a new subaddress in the Receive screen by tapping the + next to the Subaddresses button. Enter a name for the subaddress and tap Add. Then just tap on the subaddress name when you want to use it!\nIf you’re paranoid, you should probably create a new subaddress every time you receive Monero.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What is a transaction ID?",
    "answer" : "A transaction hash, or transaction ID, is a unique way to identify any transaction. Each transaction has its own hash. If you need to provide a transaction hash to somebody, just go to the main Wallet screen, tap on the transaction, long-press on the top section, and select Copy.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "I didn't receive my XMR! What can I do?",
    "answer" : "If you didn't receive your Monero, you might want to tap the ••• menu and hit Reconnect. If that doesn't work, go into the settings menu, tap the 'Current Node' box, and select a node with a green dot next to it.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "I didn't receive my coins from the exchange in the app. What can I do?",
    "answer" : "If you're having issues with an exchange, the best option is to contact the exchange itself. We're partnered with ChangeNow, SimpleSwap, SideShift and Trocador. So your best bet is to go to https://changenow.io, https://simpleswap.io/, https://sideshift.ai/, https://trocador.app/ and contact their support.\n"

    "question" : "How do I contact Cake Wallet support?",
